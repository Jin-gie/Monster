The goal of the monster project was to develop a simulator of the life of a monster with several possible actions:
* Run: the monster goes for a run and loses hp
* Fight: the monster fights against another monster and loses hp
* Work: the monster works hard and loses hp but earns money
* Sleep: the monster sleeps during a certain amount of time and regains hp
* Eat: the monsters gains hp against a bit of money

At a given interval of time, a random action among those above is activated.

It is also possible to restart the game with a new life and to kill the monster. The actions of the monster are registered in a log window.
